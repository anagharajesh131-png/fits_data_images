# FITS Data Analysis of Source 3C75

## üìö Overview
This repository contains a basic analysis of FITS data for the radio source **3C75**. The main goal is to generate and visualize the Stokes parameters (I, Q, U, V) as images, as well as compute the **Polarized Intensity (P)** and **Polarization Angle**. The analysis uses Python with Astropy and Matplotlib.

## ‚úÖ Files in This Repository

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Python Code Files
- `plot_fits_new.py`  
  A Python script to:
  - Read the FITS files for Stokes I, Q, U, and V.
  - Generate and save images of each Stokes parameter with RA/Dec axes.
  - Compute and save the Polarized Intensity and Polarization Angle images.

- `header_of_fits_file.py`  
  A Python script to extract and print the full header information from a FITS file.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Files
- FITS Files (not included in the repo due to size):  
  The following files are used as input:
    - `3C75_final_large.pbcor_cropped.fits` (Stokes I)
    - `3C75_final.Q_02_cropped.fits` (Stokes Q)
    - `3C75_final.U_02_cropped.fits` (Stokes U)
    - `3C75_final.V_02_cropped.fits` (Stokes V)

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Output Files
- `header_output.txt`  
  Contains the full header metadata of the Stokes I FITS file, providing key information such as observing date, telescope, coordinate system, pixel scale, and more.

- Images (generated by the code):
    - `Stokes_I_RA_Dec.png`
    - `Stokes_Q_RA_Dec.png`
    - `Stokes_U_RA_Dec.png`
    - `Stokes_V_RA_Dec.png`
    - `Polarized_Intensity_RA_Dec.png`
    - `Polarization_Angle_RA_Dec.png`

## ‚ö° How To Run

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib astropy
    ```

2. Run the header extraction script:
    ```bash
    python header_of_fits_file.py
    ```

3. Run the main FITS visualization and analysis script:
    ```bash
    python plot_fits_new.py
    ```

4. Outputs will be saved in the specified output folder:
    - Images with proper RA and Dec axes for scientific interpretation.

## üìä Insights
- The images allow visualization of the surface brightness distribution in different Stokes parameters.
- Polarized Intensity and Polarization Angle provide key insights into the source‚Äôs magnetic field structure.
- The header gives important metadata such as beam size, observing frequency, telescope information, and coordinate reference system (J2000).

---

## üîß Notes
- The code uses the **World Coordinate System (WCS)** to ensure the axes are in RA and Dec, not just pixel coordinates.
- Polarized Intensity is calculated as:  
  `P = sqrt(Q¬≤ + U¬≤)`
- Polarization Angle (in degrees) is calculated as:  
  `angle = 0.5 * arctan2(U, Q) * (180 / œÄ)`
